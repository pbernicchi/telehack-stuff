                                Telehack

    Telehack is a simulation of a stylized arpanet/usenet, circa 1985-1990.
    It is a full multi-user simulation, including 26,600+ simulated hosts
    from the early net, thousands of files from the era, a collection of
    adventure and IF games, a working BASIC interpreter with a library of
    programs to run, simulated historical users, and more.


Connecting
----------

On the web: https://telehack.com/

or open a shell and type:

    telnet telehack.com

Telehack is accessible via:

  * Telnet on ports 23 (the standard telnet port), 1337, 8080, and 31173
  * HTTPS on port 443 (the standard HTTPS port)
  * SSH on port 6668
  * FTP on port 21 (the standard ftp port) NOTE: The FTP server is RFC 959
  compliant and will likely not work with more modern FTP clients

Accessibility
-------------

Non-sighted users: please type STTY /dumb after connecting to Telehack.
This will invoke plain terminal mode in the Z-code games and avoid using
ANSI cursor-addressing.

For users connecting with Teletypes or other Teleprinter Terminal setups
please type STTY /tty after connection to switch Telehack into a more Teletype
friendly mode.

About this Document
-------------------

Telehack is case-insensitive.  Commands are often shown in uppercase to
distinguish them from surrounding text.  Note that you do not need to type
commands in all-caps.  For example:

    Type DIR for a list of files

You may type DIR or dir to obtain a list of files.

In help messages, <> signifies required arguments to commands, whereas
[] signifies optional arguments.  The pipe symbol | signifies "or" or an
alternative.  For example:

    send <user|port> [message]

means that a user or port must follow the send command, but that the
message argument is optional (send will prompt for messages lines if you
do not specify one on the command line).

    @ send forbin hello
    @ send 15 hello

    @ send forbin
    forbin> hello
    forbin>


Getting Help
------------

You can type ? at any prompt to get a list of available commands:

    @ ?
    Command, one of the following:
      2048        ?           a2          ac          advent      aquarium
      basic       bf          c8          cal         calc        ching
      clear       clock       cowsay      date        ddate       echo
      eliza       factor      figlet      finger      fnord       geoip
      help        ipaddr      joke        login       mac         md5
      morse       newuser     notes       octopus     phoon       pig
      ping        pong        primes      privacy     qr          rain
      rand        rfc         rig         roll        rot13       sleep
      starwars    traceroute  typespeed   units       uptime      usenet
      users       uumap       uupath      uuplot      weather     when
      zc          zork        zrun

The HELP command provides one-line descriptions of command functions,
including any modifier arguments that may be available. Examples:

    @ help
    @ help telnet
    @ help ftp


Getting Unstuck
---------------

Any command may be terminated by typing ^C (control-C).  To log out of a
remote host or exit a subshell, type ^D (control-D), EXIT or QUIT.

Note: The Apple II interpreter requires typing ^C twice to exit.

Control Characters
------------------

A control key (CTRL) initiates a number of system functions when it is used
in conjunction with  another character.

To type a control character, hold down the control key, and at the same
time press the character you want.  For example:  to type a CTRL-C, hold
down the control key and  at  the  same  time  press the letter C.  In most
cases this prints (echoes) on your terminal as ^C.  In system documentation,
a control character such as control-C may also be described as CTRL-C or ^C.

Special control characters:

    ctrl-C         interrupt program
    ctrl-N         next line
    ctrl-P         previous line
    ctrl-R         quick relay (requires backgrounded relay)
    ctrl-T         print system status
    ctrl-W         delete word
    (up arrow)     previous line
    (next arrow)   next line
    (tab)          autocomplete next command/file/user/host


Quick Fun
---------

Type STARWARS to view the pinnacle of ASCII-mation, a full-length rendition
of Star Wars in ASCII.

Typing JOKE will display a joke randomly selected from a massive unified
historical arpanet/caltech joke database.

Type Aquarium to watch an animated aquarium in ASCII art.

NLI Lobby
---------

When you first connect to Telehack, you will be in the not-logged-in
lobby.  The NLI lobby is indicated by the '.' prompt:

    $ telnet telehack.com Trying 64.13.147.30...  Connected
    to telehack.com.  Escape character is '^]'.

    Connected to TELEHACK port 13

    It is 8:16 am on Saturday, April 30, 2011 in Mountain View, California, USA.
    There are 10 local users. There are 24139 hosts on the network.

      Type ? for a command list.
      Type HELP for a more detailed command listing.
      Type control-C to interrupt any command.

    May the command line live forever.

    Command, one of the following:
      2048        ?           a2          ac          advent      aquarium
      basic       bf          c8          cal         calc        ching

      zc          zork        zrun
    .

A limited subset of commands are available in the lobby.

To login or create a new account, type LOGIN.


Pager Commands
--------------

When viewing any paginated output on Telehack, you may receive a --More--
prompt. This may be seen in the commands type, cat, more, less, as well as
any command which produces paginated output.

At the --More-- prompt, the following single-key commands may be typed:

    space   show next page
    b       back one page
    q       quit
    g       go to top
    G       go to bottom
    return  down one line
    j       down one line
    k       up one line
    /       search for a given string

The pager also supports several pipes. These can be appended to commands that
produce paginated output:

    grep <pattern>     show lines matching pattern
    grep -c <pattern>  show number of lines matching
    grep -i <pattern>  case insensitive matching
    grep -v <pattern>  show lines NOT matching pattern
    sort [field]       sort output (field can be column header or number)
    sort -r [field]    reverse sorting
    wc -c              show number of characters
    wc -l              show number of lines (including header)
    wc -m              show maximum line length
    wc -w              show number of words

For example:

    @ users | grep Mountain View, CA | sort username


Network Hosts
-------------

There are approximately 26,600 virtual hosts on the Telehack network.
These represent systems that were on the early Usenet/arpanet as well
as defunct BBS systems from the 80's and 90's.

Type HOSTS to see a partial list of network hosts.  Type HELP HOSTS for
more information on the hosts command.

A collection of retro files has been distributed across the hosts in the
network.  The files were sourced from the extensive archive assembled by
Jason Scott of Textfiles.com as well as other sources.


Telnetting to Hosts
-------------------

You may telnet to any host appearing in your netstat list:

    @ netstat
       host      organization                               location

    mimsy$

If you have not yet hacked into a host, you can try to login as the guest
user.  The full set of commands on the host may not be available if you are
logged in as guest.


Dialing a host
--------------

You may connect to a host by using the DIAL command.

	@dial 3148372840
  dialing ATDT (314) 837-2840    CONNECT 9600

Connected to THEOASIS


Hacking a Host
--------------

    @ dir *.exe
      porthack.exe  wardial.exe
    @ porthack
    [run porthack.exe]
    host? mimsy
    probing MIMSY for open sockets...

Once a host has been successfully hacked, you should be able to log into it
using your Telehack username and password.

Note that hosts which have been hacked and which you can log in to with
your username/password are identified in the netstat list with a '*'.


Collecting and Moving Programs
------------------------------

DIR *.exe or ls *.exe. You will be able to transfer programs between hosts
using the FTP command. On each host, a dedicated part of the disk has been
made available to you, in which you can store these programs.

Be careful not to overfill it, check your disk usage with the DF command
before transferring a file.

Example of an FTP session:

is1$ ftp uunet
Connected to uunet.
220 uunet FTP server (Version 4.109 Wed Nov 19 21:52:18 CST 1986) ready.
Name (uunet:johndoe): johndoe
331 Password required for johndoe
Password: ********
230 User johndoe logged in
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using BIN mode to transfer files.
ftp> put porthack.exe
200 PORT command successful
...


Historical Users
----------------

The 26,600 virtual hosts within Telehack were real systems available via
modem dialup, fidonet, uucp/usenet, or on the arpanet in the 1980's and
90's.  Real people used these systems and could often be seen logged in
doing work, reading, socializing or playing games.

Data archaeology applied against the oldest available uucp archives, UUCP
network maps from the era, as well as other available electronic sources
has allowed Telehack to reconstruct the online occupants of these vanished
network hosts.

To see users logged into a Telehack host, use the FINGER @host command:

Guessing Passwords
------------------

Users in the past did not always choose strong passwords.  A common
hacking method was to try various common passwords such as "secret",
"love", "trustno1", etc. to find a way into a system.

As well, upon closer inspection of hosts, you might find
that you don't have to guess. . .


Z-Code Games
------------

A collection of games written for the Z-Machine have been distributed
across the hosts in the Telehack network.  Z-Code games are identified by
the .GAM extension:

    @ ls *.gam
      advent.gam   lostpig.gam  zork.gam

    @ run advent.gam

    Welcome to Adventure

    At End Of Road
    You are standing at the end of a road before a small
    brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream
    flows out of the building and down a gully.

    >

    login and use the save command..


BASIC Interpreter
-----------------

To enter the basic interpreter, type BASIC.

    @ basic
    Dartmouth DTSS TeleBASIC (c) 1964,1966,1969,1970,1971,1979

The basic interpreter subsystem has a number of historical programs
compiled from the SIMTEL archives as well as other sources. To see a full
list of available programs, type DIR within basic.  You can load a program
with LOAD or begin execution with RUN.

Basic commands are:

    > help
    delete                   delete a user program
    dir                      directory of basic programs
    help                     print this list
    list                     list the program in memory
    load <file>              load program from file
    quit                     exit the basic interpreter
    renumber [start[,inc]]   renumber the program in memory
    run                      run the program in memory
    run <program>            load and run the specified program file
    save <file>              save a user program


Example basic session:

    @ basic
    Dartmouth DTSS TeleBASIC (c) 1964,1966,1969,1970,1971,1979
    > ?

To disassemble CPU instructions instead, use the l command:

    *l

If an entry point in the system monitor is known, you can execute it with
the g command:

    *2425152g

To return to the Telehack command shell from the system monitor,
use the r command.


Remote Terminal Monitoring
--------------------------

The link command will connect a remote user's tty to your tty.  This will
let you assist the remote user by being able to view the remote output.

    @ link <user or port>

In this case, the other user would see something like

    .
    %link from port 16 user forbin

And their session from that point would be mirrored on the linking
user's terminal.

There is also a separate facility within ptycon to allow simultaneous
monitoring of all connected ports.


Finger from Outside
-------------------

Telehack also responds to finger requests from the outside Internet on port 79:

Usenet Archive
--------------

Type USENET to view the Usenet archive.

The archive was originally collected by Henry Spencer at the University of
Toronto beginning in 1981. Later it was rescued by David G. Wiseman from
the University of Western Ontario, who drove two hours in a pickup truck to
collect 141 magtapes and save them from destruction:

    If I recall correctly, the issue of Henry Spencer's (actually,
    the University of Toronto, Department of Zoology's) NetNews
    archive was raised at a Usenix conference in the early 90's.
    The question: can we get at them? Bruce Jones was especially
    interested in this. Henry's answer was that it really wasn't
    going to be easy because he had neither the disk space nor the
    tape drive to pull them all down to make them available.

    I, it turned out, did. So one bright winter day I drove from
    London (Ontario Canada) to Toronto (Ontario Canada) -- a two
    hour drive in my shiny new pickup truck and picked up 141
    magtapes from the Zoology department at UofT and brought them
    back to the Department of Computer Science at the University
    of Western Ontario. (A not unimpressive bandwidth, by the way,
    of some 18Mb/sec :-) never underestimate the bandwidth of a
    pickup truck on the highway )

Telehack which have been provided from other sources.


Halt
----

Halting the CPU to enter the system monitor is not advised.  However, if
you do this, the operator will usually supply a monitor entry point to
enable CPU restart and re-entry into the Telehack exec.


Shortcuts
---------

    !!    repeat last command
    .     repeat last command

How to enable telnet in Windows 7, 10, and 11
---------------------------------------------

Windows 7, 10 and 11 ship with a telnet client, but it is shut off by default.
To enable it, do the following:

    Start
    Control Panel
    Programs And Features
    Turn Windows features on or off
    Check Telnet Client
    Hit OK

After that, you can open a command prompt and type

    telnet telehack.com
